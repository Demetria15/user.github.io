            <h3>The problem</h3>
            <p>To get started, I wanted to dig deeper to understand the problem of my users. I understood that the users need an easy way to connect to a professional psychologist or therapist from everywhere in their mother tongue to feel
              comfortable
              and secure because they wish to feel safe while connecting and talking to a therapist or psychologist.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="textlarge">
            <h3>Possible solution</h3>
            <p>It is an app that allows users to connect easily to a professional psychologist or therapist and an online community for those who wish to share experiences. By offering health specialists in different languages and profiles with work
              experience and specialization, the users can feel safe and open up to talk.</p>
            <p>The psychologists will be available through video, chat, phone service, and in-person sessions for those who want an in-person session. The online community will be accessible after the sign-up, where users can be anonymous. The
              community's access is given once a user has booked a session and the product has monitoring support to create a safe and trustful atmosphere.</p>
            <p>The interface will be simple and include free posts about different mental problems and suggestions on coping better with daily life problems. Blog articles are written by health specialists and also verified.</p>

          <div class="textlarge">
            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <p><i>At the discovery phase of my project, I conducted user interviews to understand their problem better.</i></p>
            <p>I conducted three interviews with friends since I believed that interviewing them would give me a more in-depth insight into their pain-points of opening up and talking about their problems. I wanted to know how they dealt with their
              issues in their life and what kind of support they were looking for.</p>
            <h4>What were my findings?</h4>
            <ul class="listspace">
              <li>All participants had in common that they want to feel connected with an online therapist since they want to trust them and open up to talk about their problems.</li>
              <li>Security and confidentiality are critical, and how the data is shared and kept secure.</li>
              <li>They have had a curious attitude about the idea of consulting an online therapist.</li>
              <li>They value that a therapist cares about them and does not work only to make money.</li>
              <li>A licensed therapist with knowledge is crucial since participants want to get quick and reliable answers.</li>
              <li>A lack of this app's usage would be that the therapist and user are not in the same room, and the atmosphere as in real-life therapy sessions is getting lost.
                <p class="indent"><i>My idea to solve this problem is to offer in-person sessions at the therapist's place for those that want to meet their therapist face to face regularly or on-demand. By providing this, users that want to have a
                    personal session
                    can
                    also use the app, and it makes it flexible for the user how they want to have their sessions.</i></p>
              </li>
              <li>A community to feel connected and open up is a good idea.</li>

            <p><i>Based on the interviews, I created two personas. Let me introduce you to <strong>Simon</strong> and <strong>Melissa.</strong></i></p>
            <p>Simon represents a single man at the age of 35 that recently separated from his girlfriend and facing some problems dealing with it. In contrast, Melissa, 30 years is soon getting married and feeling stressed about the wedding
              preparations and dealing with people that stress her.</p>
            <p><i>I referred to them throughout the entire product development process.</i></p>
            <p>While working on my User Personas, I understood why personas were valuable and how they could be put into action when I started to create them, and then something interesting happened:</p>
            <p>My process became more efficient, fun, and alive. Never before had I seen such a boost in clarity, productivity, and success in my work. Personas will supercharge my work, too, and help me take my design to the next level.</p>

          <p class="textlarge">User flows are beneficial since it is a visual presentation that makes it possible to go through each step a user can follow. I wanted to understand how Simon and Melissa would interact with the service.</p>
          <p class="textlarge">Starting with paper sketches, I created several user flows to understand every single task, and then I created the final User flows in Draw.io.</p>
          <p class="textlarge">I tested Melissa's journey through the app to understand if the journey is smooth and frictionless with the drafted user flow. I imagined that Melissa is visiting the app for the first time. Melissa wants to filter a
            list of
            therapists independently, so I wondered if she still should have the option to choose the assistant if she changes her mind. So I added a possibility for her to have the matching support with the assistant as well. Another improvement
            that I have made is that Melissa can add a health security number to see if the health insurance covers her therapy costs.</p>
          <p class="textlarge">I enjoyed the sketching part on paper since I could iterate several times on my flows.</p>

            <h3>High fidelity prototype</h3>
            <p>Taking my mid-fidelity prototypes to the next level, I created a high-fidelity clickable prototype. This prototype is not the final design, but having a high-fidelity prototype makes my product more imaginative and functional to test
              with Melissa and Simon. The end goal is to design a user-friendly, frictionless product. Check out my high-fidelity prototype <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/0165763b-7caa-4a7d-7c57-3cd23aa19762-7754/">here.</a>

            <p>Conducting usability tests with Simon, Melissa, and other participants, I started to reiterate my high-fidelity prototypes. I discovered improvement areas and started to think of how to redesign the screens.</p>
            <p>The errors that I discovered are the following, as you can see displayed below:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Clicking the "Get matched now" button did not connect to the assistant</li>

          </div>
          <p class="textlarge">Working on my first UX design project, I learned so many things, from research to hands-on design. Designing simply is challenging but also rewarding in the end. Focusing on the end-user throughout the design process is
            crucial to
            building successful products.</p>
          <p class="textlarge">One key takeaway is User testing to understand how people really think and feel about the product. Receiving valuable feedback and iterating continually is something that challenged me truly.</p>
